Drive Now - Find the closest cars that need refilling
---

Tiny webapp that takes your location and shows you the three closest
DriveNow cars that need refuelling (so you can earn bonus minutes).

Also shown are the nearest tank stations (or electro charging stations)
where you can refill the car.

Unfortunately since the applink options for DriveNow aren't clear or
obvious, the reserve link will only open the DriveNow app but doesn't
link directly to the car.

Website is running on [heroku](https://dnbm.herokuapp.com).

Deployment
---

You'll need a google api key for the maps and the drive now api key that
is the same for everyone.
